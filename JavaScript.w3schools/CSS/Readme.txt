CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is about how to apply style such as color 
and font to html documents. HTML itself is generally only concerned with the content
of a web page, whereas style should generally be specified in an external css file.

However, style can be applied to individual html files by using "internal" css,
where you specify the style in the "head" section of the html file.

In a similar manner, you can apply style to individual elements of an html file,
by using "inline" css.
