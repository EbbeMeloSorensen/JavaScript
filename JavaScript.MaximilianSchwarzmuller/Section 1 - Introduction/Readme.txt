The first folder doesn't use JavaScript - it only uses HTML and CSS, 
so the user experience is just a matter of switching between different html pages.

The second folder is just a copy of the first one, but where we are using JavaScript 
for showing some modal popup dialogs instead of switching to a different html page.
This provides for a richer user experience.
